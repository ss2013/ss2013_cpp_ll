Every student has a unique student id at school. So we could define map<int,string>, where key is student id and value is student name. Please complete the class defined below.
    class student
    {
    private:
        map<int,string> stu;
    public:
        void reg(int,string);
        bool graduate(int,string);
        string findName(int);
    };
 
reg is a function to register a student.
graduate means a student will graduate if it exists, then delete it’s information and return true. Otherwise, the function does nothing and returns false.
findName is a function to find a student’s name by student id. Return the student’s name if it exists, otherwise return a null string “”.
