In a inheritance hierarchy, there are a base class Base, which has a function print() that can print its class name, and another class Derived which is a subclass of Base.
Now please complete an appropriate inheritance hierarchy and corresponding member function, make it meet the result of the following procedures:

    Base *pTest1 = new Base;
    Base *pTest2 = new Derived;
    pTest1->print();
    pTest2->print();
    delete pTest1;
    delete pTest2;

The corresponding output:
    Base
    Derived
    Base destruct
    Derived destruct
    Base destruct
