If a pointâ€™s dimension is high, it is harder to deal with. But I trust you.
Given the below class:
    class Point
    {
    private:
        int *data;
        int dimension;
    public:
        Point(int);
        Point(int*, int);
        Point operator+(const Point&);
        Point operator-(const Point&);
        Point& operator=(const Point&);
        void print();
    };

You should initialize in the construct function, the parameter is the dimension of the point. Overload +, - and =. When a point add with another, we simply add all of their dimensions. Minus is same with add. If dimensions of the two points are different, we could do like (1,2,3,5)+(1,2,3)=(2,4,6,5). If point A is (1,2,3,5), point B is (1,4,3), then A is (1,4,3) after the operation A=B. The print function prints information of the point, like (1,2,5).
