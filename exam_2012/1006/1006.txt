This is a dictionary class Dict. It supports word definition (the words are case insensitive). Now please complete many appropriate functions to achieve the following requirements(d is an object of the class Dict):
(1) d[“pixel”] = “picture element”;
This operation shows the definition of pixel is “picture element”. 
The following statement:
cout<< d[“pixel”];
will print the definition of the word pixel, if the word is not in the dictionary, print “*** not in dictionary”;
(2) d.remove(“pixel”);
    This operation will delete the word pixel and its definition from the dictionary.
(3) d.size();
This operation will get the size of the dictionary(how many words are there in the dictionary).
(4)cout<<d;
This operation will output all the words and their definition in the dictionary in lexicographic order of the words.

For example：
    d[“pixel”] = “picture element”;
    d[“set”] = “math element”;
    cout<<d[“pixel”]<<endl;
    cout<<d[“SET”]<<endl;
    cout<<d[“java”]<<endl;
    d.remove(“pixel”);
    d[“java”] = “computer element”;
    cout<<d[“pixel”]<<endl;
    cout<<d.size()<<endl;
    cout<<d;

The result：
    picture element
    math element
    *** not in dictionary
    *** not in dictionary
    2
    java->computer element
    set->math element
