There is a class named Calculator. It has a member function getResult() which can calculate the value of the expression. Please complete the design and implementation of the class.
Something you should be noticed:
(1)The expression includes only digits and symbol +, -, *, /, (, and ).
(2)The expression is guaranteed to be valid.

Notice: The operation / is like the division in our code. For example, 3/4=0 and 6/5=1.

For example:
    Calculator c;
    cout<<c.getResult(“25/5+4”)<<endl;
    cout<<c.getResult(“(3+4)*5”)<<endl;
    cout<<c.getResult(“3/4+1”)<<endl;
    cout<<c.getResult(“2*20+1”)<<endl;

The result:
    9
    35
    1
    41
